## Problem Description

Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
1.Virtual Boardroom Experience: A web-based interface simulating a real-life interview with video conferencing, starting with ice-breaking questions and progressing to in-depth techno-managerial questions based on the candidate’s level.

2.AI-Driven Question Matching: Use AI to suggest relevant questions from a categorized question bank, tailored to the candidate’s expertise and job role.

3.Response Evaluation System: Implement NLP to analyze and score candidate responses for relevance, accuracy, and depth, alongside grading interviewer questions for appropriateness.

4.Scoring Dashboard: Provide real-time scores for both interviewers and candidates, culminating in an overall suitability score for the candidate.

5.Feedback Mechanism: Offer post-interview feedback and detailed reports to improve the process and inform RAC leadership.
